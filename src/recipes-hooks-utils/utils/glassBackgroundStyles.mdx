# Glass Background Recipe

CSS recipe for creating glass morphism backgrounds with backdrop blur. These styles are automatically included when you import the design system.

The recipe provides two classes:
- `.glass-background-dark`: Glass effect for dark themes
- `.glass-background-light`: Glass effect for light themes

## Import

The CSS is automatically available when you import the design system. To use the class names in your code:

```tsx
import { glassBackgroundClasses } from "@movementlabsxyz/movement-design-system";
```

## Setup

**No setup required!** The CSS is automatically included when you import the design system's main CSS:

```tsx
// In your app entry point (e.g., main.tsx, index.tsx, _app.tsx)
import "@movementlabsxyz/movement-design-system/style.css";
```

The glass background styles are part of the `recipes.css` file that's automatically imported with the design system.

## CSS Classes Created

Once injected, these classes are available:

### .glass-background-dark
Glass morphism effect for dark themes with dark gradient and light border.

### .glass-background-light
Glass morphism effect for light themes with light gradient and dark border.

## Usage Example

After injecting the styles, use with `glassBackgroundClasses`:

```tsx
import { glassBackgroundClasses } from "@movementlabsxyz/movement-design-system";

export function GlassCard() {
  const isDarkMode = true; // Get from your theme context
  
  return (
    <div 
      className={
        isDarkMode 
          ? glassBackgroundClasses.dark 
          : glassBackgroundClasses.light
      }
    >
      <div className="p-6">
        Card with glass morphism effect
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
